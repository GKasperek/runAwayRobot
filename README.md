# Project

This is personnal project on unity. Some basics functions are implemented to build a 2D Game. Not sure about the end of the development. Maybe a random auto-scroller or defined level or both I don't really know atm. I'm gonna dev some others functions like multiple weapon and boon/debuff. I would like to build a rogue-like game. My first move was to develop a auto-scroller roguelike mobile game (is this a real category?) to conjugate quick run of mobile game and complexity of rogue lite. I think i'm gonna stay one this one but I need more thinking...


I have done all the sprites *except the background* please don't take care of the poor level of design. If I continue it, it's very possible that it is not final. (I need tablet drawing with a mouse is difficult even in pixel art)

I think this game dev is in pause for the moment. I want to develop a complete game but this one is to big/complex for me at this time. I will try to do something easier then come back on this one later because I really think it could be great and interesting (more likely because I'm in love with Hades).
